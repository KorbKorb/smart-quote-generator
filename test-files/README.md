## Creating More Test Files:

### For DXF Files:
- Use any free CAD software like LibreCAD, QCAD, or DraftSight
- Draw simple shapes (rectangles, circles, lines)
- Save as DXF format

### For Real DWG Files:
- DWG files are proprietary AutoCAD format
- Use AutoCAD or free alternatives like DraftSight
- Or download samples from: https://www.cadtest.com/downloads/

### For More Test Files:
- Search for "sample DXF files" or "sample DWG files" online
- Many CAD software websites offer free samples
- GitHub has repositories with CAD test files

## Notes:
- The PDF file is a minimal valid PDF for testing
- Real production files would be more complex
- DXF files are text-based and can be edited in a text editor
