# Smart Quote Generator - Project Checkpoint (Post-Organization)
*Created: January 2025*

## 🎯 Current Project State

### Project Overview
- **Name**: Smart Quote Generator
- **Purpose**: AI-powered quote generation system for HFI Metal Fabrication
- **Tech Stack**: React (Frontend) + Node.js/Express (Backend) + MongoDB
- **Deployment**: AWS Amplify (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)

### ✅ Recent Accomplishments

1. **File Organization Completed**:
   - Moved 50+ files from root directory into organized folders
   - Created `/scripts/` directory for all automation scripts
   - Created `/scripts/tests/` for test scripts
   - Moved all documentation to `/docs/`
   - Created `/config/` for configuration files
   - Updated all affected scripts to work from new locations

2. **Clean Project Structure**:

## 📝 Important Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend && npm start

# Start frontend
cd frontend && npm start

# Run health check
node scripts/health-check.js

# Generate JWT secret
node scripts/generate-jwt-secret.js
```

### Deployment
```bash
