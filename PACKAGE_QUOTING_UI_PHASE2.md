# Package Quoting System - Phase 2 UI Components

## Overview
The Package Quoting System UI has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### 1. **PackageBuilder Component** (`/frontend/src/components/PackageQuoting/PackageBuilder.jsx`)
The main entry point for creating package quotes.

**Features:**
- Multi-line text input area for entering multiple products
- Sample text button for quick testing
- Real-time parsing of product entries
- Support for multiple input formats:
  - `Product Name - Quantity`
  - `Product Name (Quantity)`
  - `Product Name x Quantity`
  - `Product Name, qty: Quantity`
- Visual feedback for found vs. not found products
- Quantity adjustment before calculating pricing

### 2. **CategoryGroup Component** (`/frontend/src/components/PackageQuoting/CategoryGroup.jsx`)
Displays products grouped by category with collapsible sections.

**Features:**
- Collapsible category headers showing item count and subtotal
- Individual item controls with quantity adjustment
- Remove item functionality
- Category discount display
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### 3. **PackageSummary Component** (`/frontend/src/components/PackageQuoting/PackageSummary.jsx`)
Shows the final package quote with pricing breakdown.

**Features:**
- Package statistics (total items, categories, discounts)
- Detailed price breakdown with all applied discounts
- Savings banner showing total discount amount and percentage
- Items grouped by category with totals
- Action buttons for saving and exporting
- Applied discount rules display

### 4. **PackageQuote Page** (`/frontend/src/pages/PackageQuote.jsx`)
The main page that orchestrates the package quoting workflow.

**Features:**
- Three-step process: Build → Review → Summary
- Visual step indicator
- State management for package items and pricing
- Error handling and loading states
- Responsive layout

## Styling
All components use the pine green theme with:
- Primary color: `#1A4D46` (Pine Green)
- Accent warm: `#D97559` (Terracotta/Coral for CTAs)
- Semantic colors for success, warning, and error states
- Consistent shadows and hover effects
- Mobile-responsive design

## API Integration
The components integrate with the backend API endpoints:
- `POST /api/package-quotes/parse-products` - Parse text input
- `POST /api/package-quotes/calculate-pricing` - Calculate package pricing
- `POST /api/package-quotes/create` - Save package quote

## Usage

### To access the Package Quote feature:
1. Navigate to `/admin/package-quote` in the application
2. Enter products in the text area using any supported format
3. Click "Parse Products" to identify products
4. Review and adjust quantities in the Review step
5. Calculate final pricing to see discounts and totals
6. Save or export the quote

### Sample Input:
```
Mild Steel Sheet 4x8 x 5
I-Beam 6" - 20
Hex Bolt 1/2" x 2" (200)
Flat Washer 1/2", 300
Square Tube 2x2x1/4 - 15 pieces
```

## Next Steps (Phase 3 - Pricing Logic)
- Implement volume discount calculator
- Create bundle rule engine
- Add discount preview/simulator
- Build price override capability

## Testing
To test the Package Quoting system:
1. Start the backend server: `npm run dev` in the backend directory
2. Start the frontend: `npm start` in the frontend directory
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/package-quote`
4. Use the sample text or enter your own products
5. Follow the workflow through all three steps

## Notes
- The system assumes products exist in the database (populated by migration script)
- Products not found in the catalog are clearly marked
- All quantities can be adjusted before final pricing
- Discounts are automatically applied based on backend rules
