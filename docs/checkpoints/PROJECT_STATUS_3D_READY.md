# Smart Quote Generator - Project Status
*Last Updated: January 10, 2025*

AI-powered quote generation system for sheet metal fabrication with DXF file parsing and 3D visualization.

**Tech Stack**:
- Frontend: React 18 + Tailwind CSS + Three.js
- Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- DXF Parsing: dxf-parser npm package
- 3D Visualization: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- Deployment: AWS Amplify (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Security Implementation** (COMPLETED)
- Environment variable validation
- Input validation middleware for all endpoints
- Rate limiting (different limits for different operations)
- JWT authentication with secure token generation
- MongoDB query sanitization
- Helmet.js security headers
- Comprehensive error handling and logging with Winston

### 2. **DXF Parser** (WORKING)
- Located at: `backend/src/utils/dxfParser.js`
- Successfully parses DXF files and extracts:
  - Area, perimeter, cut length
  - Hole detection (count and positions with diameters)
  - Bend line detection (on BEND layer)
  - Complexity assessment
  - Manufacturability warnings
- Test files in: `test-files/` (chassis-panel.dxf, enclosure-flat.dxf, etc.)

### 3. **Quote Calculation** (ENHANCED)
- Supports both old format (items array) and new format (direct parameters)
- Material pricing: Cold Rolled Steel ($0.85/lb), SS304 ($2.50/lb), SS316 ($3.20/lb), Al6061 ($1.80/lb)
- **NEW: Size-based hole pricing**:
  - Small holes (<0.25"): $0.30/hole
  - Medium holes (0.25"-0.75"): $0.50/hole
  - Large holes (0.75"-2.0"): $0.75/hole
  - Very large holes (>2.0"): $1.25/hole
- Operation costs: Cutting ($0.10/inch), Bending ($5.00/bend)
- Finish options: Powder coat, anodize, zinc plate
- Rush multipliers: Standard (1x), Rush (1.25x), Emergency (1.5x)

### 4. **API Endpoints** (TESTED & WORKING)
- `POST /api/quotes/analyze-dxf` - Analyzes uploaded DXF file
- `POST /api/quotes/calculate` - Calculates quote with optional DXF data
- `GET /api/quotes/materials` - Lists available materials
- All endpoints have validation and rate limiting

### 5. **3D Visualization Components** (CREATED - READY FOR TESTING)
- **Enhanced3DViewer Component** (`frontend/src/components/DXF/Enhanced3DViewer.jsx`)
  - Multiple view modes (3D, Flat, Wireframe)
  - Material coloring based on selection
  - Bend line visualization (red dashed lines)
  - Dimension display toggle
  - Hole rendering
  
- **DXFVisualizationTest Page** (`frontend/src/pages/DXFVisualizationTest.jsx`)
  - DXF file upload
  - Material and thickness selection
  - Real-time quote calculation
  - Mock data option for quick testing

- **Routing Added**
  - Route added to App.jsx: `/admin/dxf-3d-test`
  - Navigation link added to admin menu

## üöß Current State - 3D Visualization Testing Phase

### What's Ready to Test:
1. **Mock Data Testing**
   - Click "Load Mock Data" button to test 3D viewer without files
   - Includes sample holes and bend lines

2. **Real DXF File Testing**
   - Upload any of the test DXF files
   - Backend analyzes and returns structured data
   - 3D viewer renders the part

3. **Interactive Features**
   - View mode switching
   - Material selection (changes color)
   - Show/hide dimensions and bend lines
   - Quote calculation from DXF data

### Test Instructions:
1. Start backend: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin/dxf-3d-test
4. Follow the testing guide in `docs/3D_VISUALIZATION_TEST_GUIDE.md`

## üìã Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Three.js Import Paths**: The OrbitControls import might need adjustment depending on Three.js version
2. **DXF Data Structure**: The Enhanced3DViewer expects specific data format from parser
3. **Coordinate System**: DXF uses 2D coordinates, conversion to 3D might need tweaking
4. **Scale Factor**: Parts might appear too large/small, adjust scale multiplier if needed

## üîß Environment Status
- **Backend**: Port 3002 (configured in .env)
- **MongoDB**: Connected successfully
- **Security**: All measures active (rate limiting, validation, etc.)
- **Logs**: Writing to `backend/logs/`

    routes/
      adminQuotes.js (main quotes route - NOTE: not quotes.js!)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
1. **Routes**: The main quote routes are in `routes/adminQuotes.js` NOT `src/routes/quotes.js`
2. **API Path**: Fixed import in DXFUploader from `services/api` to `utils/api`
3. **Material Names**: Two formats supported - 'cold-rolled-steel' and 'Cold Rolled Steel'
4. **MongoDB Password**: Has been changed from the exposed one
5. **JWT Secret**: New secure secret generated

## üöÄ Next Steps After 3D Testing

1. **Fine-tune 3D Rendering**
   - Adjust scale factors for better visibility
   - Improve bend line visualization
   - Add thickness extrusion for true 3D appearance

2. **Add More Visualizations**
   - Cutting path animation
   - Exploded view for parts with bends
   - Measurement tools

3. **Integrate with Main App**
   - Add 3D preview to quote creation flow
   - Save 3D snapshots with quotes
   - Export 3D view as image

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement LOD (Level of Detail) for complex parts
   - Add loading states and progress indicators
   - Cache parsed DXF data

## üí° Quick Fixes if Needed

If Three.js imports fail:
```javascript
// Try these alternatives:
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js';
// or
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';
```

If scale is wrong:
```javascript
// In Enhanced3DViewer.jsx, adjust the scale factor:
const scale = 200 / maxDim; // Change 200 to larger/smaller value
```

If materials don't show colors:
```javascript
// Check materialColors object has the correct material keys
const materialColors = {
  'cold-rolled-steel': 0x8b8c8d,
  // Add any missing material keys
};
```
