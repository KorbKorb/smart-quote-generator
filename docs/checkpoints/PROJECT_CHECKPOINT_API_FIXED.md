# Smart Quote Generator - Project Checkpoint (Post-API Fix)
*Created: January 2025*

## 🎯 Current Project State

### Project Overview
- **Name**: Smart Quote Generator
- **Purpose**: AI-powered quote generation system for HFI Metal Fabrication
- **Tech Stack**: React (Frontend) + Node.js/Express (Backend) + MongoDB
- **Deployment**: AWS Amplify (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)

### ✅ Recent Fixes & Updates

1. **API Connection Issues Resolved**:
   - Fixed frontend API calls from port 5000 to 3002
   - Updated `.env` file: `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/api`
   - Fixed hardcoded URLs in Dashboard.jsx
   - Updated fallback port in api.js

2. **Quote Calculation Endpoint Enhanced**:
   - Fixed `/api/quotes/calculate` to return proper structure
   - Added detailed pricing breakdown:
     - Material cost (weight-based)
     - Cutting cost (per inch)
     - Pierce/hole cost (per hole)
     - Bending cost (per bend)
     - Finish cost (per sq ft)
     - Rush fees (urgency-based)
   - Supports both DXF-measured and estimated calculations

3. **File Organization Completed**:
   - Scripts organized in `/scripts/`
   - Documentation in `/docs/`
   - Clean root directory structure

### 🔧 Current Configuration

#### Backend (.env)
```
PORT=3002
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=[MongoDB Atlas connection string]
JWT_SECRET=[Secure secret key]
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### Frontend (.env)
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/api
```

### 📊 Pricing Logic

#### Material Prices (per pound)
- Cold Rolled Steel: $0.85
- Stainless Steel 304: $2.50
- Stainless Steel 316: $3.20
- Aluminum 6061: $1.80

#### Operation Rates
- Cutting: $0.10 per inch
- Piercing: $0.50 per hole
- Bending: $5.00 per bend
- Finish rates vary by type

#### Rush Multipliers
- Standard (5-7 days): 1.0x
- Rush (2-3 days): 1.25x
- Emergency (24 hours): 1.5x

### 🚀 Working Features

1. **Quote Calculation**:
   - Accepts material, thickness, quantity, finish, urgency
   - Returns detailed cost breakdown
   - Shows measurement source (DXF vs estimated)

2. **DXF Analysis** (Mock data currently):
   - Simulates area, cut length, complexity
   - Ready for real DXF parser integration

3. **Customer Portal**:
   - Login/registration system
   - Quote viewing capabilities

4. **Package Quoting**:
   - Multi-product quotes
   - Discount rules engine
   - Category grouping

### 🎨 Design System
- **Primary**: Pine Green (#1A4D46)
- **Accent Warm**: Terracotta (#D97559)
- **Accent Cool**: Sky Blue (#6FA3A0)

## 🔴 Current Limitations

1. **DXF Processing**:
   - Currently returns mock data
   - No actual DXF file parsing
   - 3D viewer expects real geometry data

2. **Sample Files**:
   - Need real DXF files for testing
   - Current test files may not represent actual use cases

3. **Quote Creation**:
   - Some frontend components still being debugged
   - PDF generation not yet implemented

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Get Better Sample Files**:
   - Real sheet metal DXF files
   - Various complexity levels
   - Standard industry parts

2. **Implement DXF Parser**:
   - Parse actual geometry
   - Extract real measurements
   - Generate 3D preview data

3. **Complete Testing**:
   - Test quote calculation with real data
   - Verify 3D visualization
   - Test customer portal flow

## 💡 Known Issues to Address

1. **Frontend may still cache old API URL**:
   - Solution: Clear cache and restart
   - Use scripts/fix-frontend-connection.ps1

2. **3D Viewer needs real geometry**:
   - Currently can't display without proper DXF data

3. **MongoDB connection string is exposed**:
   - Need to update credentials before production

## 📝 Important Commands

### Development
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm start

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend && npm start

# Fix API connection issues
./scripts/fix-frontend-connection.ps1

# Test backend
node scripts/test-backend-api.js
```

### Testing Endpoints
- Health: GET http://localhost:3002/api/health
- Materials: GET http://localhost:3002/api/quotes/materials
- Calculate: POST http://localhost:3002/api/quotes/calculate
- Package Parse: POST http://localhost:3002/api/package-quotes/parse-products

## 🔐 Security Notes
- JWT authentication implemented
- CORS configured
- Rate limiting ready
- Need to secure environment variables

## 📈 Performance Considerations
- DXF parsing will be CPU intensive
- Consider caching parsed results
- 3D rendering optimization needed

## 🎯 Ready for Next Phase
The API connection issues are resolved and the quote calculation logic is working. The next critical step is to get proper DXF files and implement real parsing to make the 3D visualization and accurate quoting functional.

*Note: This checkpoint captures the state after fixing API connectivity and quote calculation structure. The system is ready for real DXF integration.*
